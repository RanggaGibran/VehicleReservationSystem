## 🧪 AFTER DEPLOYMENT - TEST THESE

1. **Health Check**: https://netdev-a401913bbb39.herokuapp.com/health
   - Should return: `{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}`

2. **Root Status**: https://netdev-a401913bbb39.herokuapp.com/
   - Should return: `{"message": "Vehicle Reservation System is running", ...}`

3. **Login Page**: https://netdev-a401913bbb39.herokuapp.com/Account/Login
   - Should load **WITHOUT HTTP 500 ERROR**
   - Should display the login form

## 🎉 EXPECTED RESULT

After deployment, your application will:
- ✅ **Start successfully** on Heroku
- ✅ **Bind to correct port** (no port conflicts)
- ✅ **Handle HTTPS properly** (Heroku manages SSL)
